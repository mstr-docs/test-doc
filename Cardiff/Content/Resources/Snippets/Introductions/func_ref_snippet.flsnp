        <p>Functions in MicroStrategy are powerful tools used in expressions to define MicroStrategy objects and initiate complex user-selected calculations. Wherever you can define an expression, you can use a function. From creating basic objects to building complex reports and analyzing data, you have the ability to create custom expressions using a large library of functions supported by MicroStrategy. Although functions are most commonly used in metric expressions, they are also used to create filters, define attribute forms, and so on.
