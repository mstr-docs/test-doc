        <p>MicroStrategy Badge is a mobile platform designed to provide security for business processes and applications across an enterprise. It replaces traditional forms of enterprise security such as ID cards, passwords, and physical keys with a mobile badge on a user’s smartphone. Users with the MicroStrategy Badge mobile app and badge can electronically validate their identity without plastic ID cards, log into online applications without entering a password, open locked doors without keys, and so on.</p>
