        <p>HyperIntelligence represents an entirely new class of applications where answers find you. These applications inject insights directly into a user’s existing workflow and transforms familiar interfaces into intelligence tools—making every person, application, and device across the enterprise more intelligent.</p>
        <p>MicroStrategy 2019 introduces cards, a new object that is built, managed, and deployed using MicroStrategy Workstation. Cards can be viewed in a web browser via MicroStrategy HyperIntelligence for Web, in Outlook through MicroStrategy HyperIntelligence for Office, or on your mobile device with MicroStrategy HyperIntelligence for Mobile. </p>
