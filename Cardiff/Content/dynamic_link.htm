        <h1>Add Contextual Links</h1>
        <p>On your card, you can add a static link or a contextual link. Static links navigate to the same URL regardless of the subject of your card. For example, having your company website appear on each of your employee cards. Alternatively, you can add a contextual link to your card. Contextual links allow you to navigate to different URLs based on your keyword attribute form, so depending on the subject of your card, the link will change.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drag your keyword attribute on to your card template.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Add a link</b> in the card header.</li>
            <li>Enter the text you want to display on your card. </li>
            <li>Click the drop-down arrow to select an icon to represent your link.<p><img src="Resources/Images/link_icons.png" /><br /></p></li>
            <li>Enter a URL and add a forward slash <b>/</b> at the end. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</li>
            <li>Add a curly bracket { and the list of your keyword attribute forms appear. Click the form to use in your link. Your URL should appear as  https://www.example.com/{keyword@form}.<div class="Note"><p>You can add multiple keyword attribute forms in your URL. For examples, see <a href="https://community.microstrategy.com/s/article/HyperIntelligence-Contextual-Link-Examples">KB483289:&#160;Contextual Links Examples</a>.</p><p>If you only want to use a keyword attribute form as the dynamic link, your attribute form must contain a full URL, including the protocol. For example, the attribute form http://example.com will work successfully; however, the attribute form example.com will not.</p></div><p><object MadCap:HTML5Video="true" src="Resources/Images/add_keyword_attribute_form.mp4" MadCap:Param_controls="false" MadCap:Param_muted="true" MadCap:Param_loop="true" MadCap:Param_autoplay="true" style="width: 25%;"></object></p></li>
